# Google Clone
I have been wanting to make a clone of something for a long time and I took the opportunity to learn something new while creating this clone.  Learning to work with Vue was a bit painful at first due to my inexperience with it but, I was able to get much more comfortable quite quickly.  This project is still being worked on as shown by the lack of icons, a few different visual bugs, and a lack of a mobile view.
